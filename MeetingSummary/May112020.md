## Discussed
- We have discussed on  3rd  chapter.
- We have seen overview of various classification problem categories, and metrics behind them.
- RandomSearch over Grid Search, In Reality - Stacking of RandomSearch and then narrowing to Grid Search
- Multi Output Classification - conceptually what it is
- Showcasing our explorations over PIMA Diabetes Dataset
- Effect of Normalisation over convergence of a Model - Optimizers ,
- Batch Normalization for DL

## Queries - to be discussed/explored(in short term upcoming session)
- Random Search - Does it picks up randomly ? or any Criteria? if so, what is the criteria .
- Multi output classification - some more details

## To be explored - research focus
- Various forms of error analysis metrics behind Classification problems
- Optimizer to converge when the data is non-normalized form
